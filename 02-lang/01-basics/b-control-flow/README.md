# Control Flow

## Statements vs Expressions

- `Expression has a value` and can be used as part of another expression.
- `Statement` is a top-level element in it's enclosing block and `doesn't have it's own value`.
- Java vs Kotlin

| Element | Java | Kotlin |
| ---  | --- | --- |
| Control Structures | All  are `Statements` | Most are `Expressions` except for loops (for, do & do-while)|
| Assignments | Are `Expressions` | Become `Statements` |

## If expression

- `if is an expression` and hence returns a value. Therefore, there is `NO TERNARY OPERATOR`.
- `if-expression` can be `blocks` and the `last expression` is the value of the block.
